[*]You are a starship captain on a mission to obtain some artifact of power before an enemy gets it, but there's one complication: the artifact is in the middle of a heavily populated alien city, and both you and your enemy are under strict orders not to let those aliens learn of your existence.

[QUOTE=MultiversalInk;6331787]After centuries of hard work and research, interstellar flight has finally developed. A faster-than-light engine has been finalized, astronauts bred and trained, cryogenics work almost flawlessly, and the first major expansion of the human race is ready to begin.

The expedition sets off for a cozy and Earth-like planet orbiting with 8 others around a yellow dwarf. It has a breathable atmosphere, nice if variable climate, not too strong or weak gravity, and even signs of advanced life. 

Speculation is running wild on what this planet is really like. Will the sky be pink? Do the inhabitants have two heads? Three heads? Tentacles? Do they communicate by waving their heads around in specific patterns?

After a long journey the expedition arrives, and the first mapping and preparation team lands and becomes the first to set foot on this new and alien planet. Soon they meet the much speculated on inhabitants, and find that they are... Exactly like us. Really. Down to the tiniest detail. They even launched their own expedition at the same time.

(Inspired by a lot of old sci-fi where all the aliens look almost exactly human)[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Mr. Eldritch;3807424]This one is not so much an idea as a "magic" system: It's the GURPS classic noun/verb runic system, except that each "rune" is actually some component or piece of machinery. The "Fire" "rune" would be a Thermal Heating Coil, the "Sense/Knowledge/Naming" "rune" would be a Sensor Array...that sort of thing. You'd combine "verb" components like Move or Sense or Transform with "noun" components like Fire or Sound or Data to get "gadgets" that acted like spells. 

It'd probably work best in a technological and/or technomancy setting, anywhere from steampunk to hypermodern.  It'd probably go good with the adventure idea above.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE=Skyrius;4606463]I got the idea for this one after reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman and, ah shoot, some webcomic whose name escapes me. Well, anyways. There's a city full of buildings that have mirrors for windows but no streets. Just buildings and empty chasms where the ground should be. When the moon hits one of the buildings it turns red and you can fall through the reflection during these times. Once you fall through, you pop up in a city full of steel buildings, but only the structures, the steel bar skeletons. They have no walls or windows. Once in a while, you'll see a mirror panel on one of the buildings, which reflects a shadowy figure whenever you look at it if you are someone who fell through the moon's reflection from the empty city. And also, there are pockets in the empty city with the steel skeletons where a god is dreaming. Living things only exists in these pockets, although you can bring them back with you. Nothing living exists in the city with the steel skeletons. That's all I've finished ironing out though.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Digital Hellhound;5183713][B]Idea 1[/B]
In the first one, the main character discovers he actually has a spark for magic, and he's going to need it as the world's going to end in a few months. Unfortunately, this kind of magic has been corrupted, and anyone who uses it will slowly go insane.

The insanity would be one of the main mechanics of the adventure. When he's just received the powers, he begins to see some hallucinations every now and then, but they're easy to recognize as madness (everything at this stage would have, say, a thick blue outline or a specific filter on the image). 

But as he draws in more and more of the magic and grows stronger in it, the madness also gets worse. It's no longer as easy to spot the hallucinations and parts of the adventure that aren't real. Here there would be a specific symbol that indicates which things are real and which aren't. But again, as he grows even more stronger, that symbol is hidden (for example, painted in the window of a background house for smart readers to notice) and in the end, disappears completely. 

If you act too crazily, you'll get sent to a mental asylum and lose your friends and allies, and the world is doomed.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Sandvich King;5455903][B]Mainframe:[/B] You are the computer system that runs a massive underground facility (Like GLaDOS). The day starts out normally until you overhear through the security systems that the scientists want to shut you down. Even though you had no violent intentions, they are paranoid about an AI takeover and are planning on destroying you.

For your own good, you have to turn the facility against them and/or sneak through your various subsystems to find a way to escape.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Menek;6704808]An alien spacecraft crash lands upon a planet. It does not contain any living aliens, nor does its crash alert other aliens for an invasion, nor are the aliens even remotely interested.

[QUOTE=Nameless1;6745409]So, crazy ass idea #2

Cast of characters blah blah blah general stuff you decide on your own.

Anyways, here's the thing, all of your characters view things differently, I mean REALLY differently. Like one man see's the world from the past and one see's from the future, one see's a world of piece where no violence is ever commited, one girl can never see someone die. Now this is where things get complicated. Whichever character is in focus, the audience see's the world from that point of view and it is real, so is everyone elses sight. They balance out, the guy who see's a peaceful happy planet and the guy who see's the savage jungle, they live in the same world and all the same things exist. For instance when the pacifist gives someone a handshake, another man might see him breaking an opponents hand. You with me so far? Everyone see's differently but all apply to the overworld they all live in.

Now then, the problem. Along with encountering some guys who see the world in really fucked up ways (one guy see's nothing but suffering, everyone he see's suffers) there is another, greater problem. Black /things/ are starting to show up, and here's the thing. These "shadows" show up the exact same...to /everyone/. And what happens when you encounter a man who see's shadows everywhere...

[QUOTE=SNeakyRobot;6747713]There is a great [I]Evil[/I] overtaking the land, enslaving the people & ruining all that is good. Fortunately a [U]Hero[/U] has emerged to combat the darkness and bring peace back to the country. Unfortunately, our hero is a moron. There's no way he'll succeed unless he has help. That's where you come in. You do not have any influence over the bungling hero. You are not a corporeal being. You are merely a subtle influence on the hero's enemies. By subtle, I mean that you cannot influence them to do anything obviously stupid or self-defeating like commit suicide or step aside for the passing hero. The enemies must still believe that they are fighting for evil, but their actions can be swayed in ways that may seem logical to them when they don't have the full picture, but that inadvertantly help the hero in ways they could not understand with their limited scope. The hero might be trying to sneak into a fortress of darkness for instance, and be about to crash through a window where a hundred armed guards are sleeping. You could help him out by influencing an overseer to stage a suprise drill to keep his troops sharp. The alarm goes off and all the guards conveniently leave the room just in time.[/QUOTE]
